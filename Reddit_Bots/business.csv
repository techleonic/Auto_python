b'Mileage Tracking Focused Phone',"b'Hello my fellow entrepreneurs,\n\nI\\u2019m starting my business as a private consultant and will be driving my car for work often. I am interested in tracking my mileage but I\\u2019m quite terrible at remembering to record it using Everlance or MileIq. Furthermore, leaving tracking on automatic drains my phone batteries that I need for the rest of the day.\n\nHas anyone tried buying a cheap $100 phone to leave in your car? My thinking is that the phone is the mileage tracker. Whenever I drive, the phone gets charged. I won\\u2019t be more than two days without driving so I see models that reported to have that long of a battery life. \n\nI did a quick search on Amazon for mileage trackers. All seems to cost the same as the $100 phone except they also have high monthly subscription cost and limited use. Vs me getting a smart phone that I purchase the lowest Google Fi plan for ($10/month) and can use it for phone calls etc.\n\nI live in the NYC metro area. Do you guys see any downsides to this? Has anyone tried this before? I think ride share drivers do this so please share your experience/advice!'",2024-11-02

Recently, I'm down by 3,000 INR in trading (I know that might not seem like a lot to some, but for me, it is).

So, this is truly my hard-earned money, but due to my urge to learn everything, I've ended up with this loss. \n\nI'm looking to make up for it by taking on some work. If you have anything, no matter how small, feel free to ask \\u2013 maybe I can help you out, and it would also help me earn some money. If there's nothing specific, even an upvote would be appreciated. \\U0001f642\n\nI can't commit to a job right now but can do freelance work. In the future, I'd love to take on a job, so if you know of any opportunities, please keep me in mind. \n\nSkills- coding , ppt , report, data , editing, marketing,  and am open to any work that can be done from home.

b'I want to license a business from a friend but don\\u2019t know how to make them an offer\\u2026.',"b'I\\u2019ll start by saying that this is a small business I am in interested in working with. \n\nThe business is based solely in the UK and creates personalised items for children. \n\nThey create Stickers, badges, key chains etc etc that are personalised to the child\\u2019s and it\\u2019s very successful from what I can see as it\\u2019s based on kids allergies which I think are a hot topic here in Australia. \n\nIt\\u2019s well designed and manufactured to a high standard and also has strong art work/characters with a very engaged owner who is the face of the company. \n\nI\\u2019d like to approach them and ask if they\\u2019re interested in expanding into australia but I don\\u2019t know how to make an offer and what terms to consider that protect both of us long term.\n\nI imagine a licensing fee is applicable but would there also be a revenue share required? \n\nAny advice is welcome and I can provide more detail as needed but didn\\u2019t want to overcomplicate. \n\nEdit: I also don\\u2019t know how much to offer. Is there a way to judge this if you don\\u2019t have access to size of the current business? '",2024-11-02

b'What business to start with 50k?',"b'About me: senior student of Computer Engineering, M21, (feeling like didn\\u2019t learn much here but i have broad knowledge of different tech but can\\u2019t develop or work on them by myself)\n\nI consider myself lucky because i won lotteries before, got quite competitive internship for summer (5% of getting in) and invested 10k that i\\u2019ve made during these 2 months in crpto which after 5 months worth 60k and about to reach 100-120k.(i expect that)(no it\\u2019s not a meme coin)(yes it\\u2019s legal)\nAlso FYI, my family moved to US 7 years ago with 0 money, so i am fortunate to go to college for free, thanks CA!\n\nI also have experience with running e-commerce but it was not successful partly because it was not for me (for my mom) so i didn\\u2019t spend much effort on it. That includes working with shopify, amazon, making a website; now she is only doing retail but plans to go online path again.\n\nI know that i can safely invest in stocks, binds, mutual funds etc. but it will be maximum 10% apr and i hope to get more with starting and running a business!     My goal is it retire at 30 and get 100k a gear after taxes, passively.\n\nAny suggestions?   '",2024-11-01

b'Why Are Corporations Owned By Layers of LLCs?',"b""I was reading the court papers of a lawsuit and found that the defendant company is owned by layers of about 7 LLCs. Each one is the sole member of the last, and so on. Many of them have names very similar to the actual company, some do not. They are all incorporated in Delaware. The last one, at the top, is a huge corporation with tens of billions in annual revenue, in a different state.\n\nNow I know just enough about LLCs to be dangerous. I understand that an LLC serves to isolate the owner company's assets from liabilities that the owned company may have. Maybe they also help reduce taxes. That's about it (the extent of my knowledge).\n\nOne thing I am sure of, it's not an accident, it has to be on purpose. Why are there so many layers? What do they all do that one or two layers can't?""",2024-11-01
